# ThreeJS-Cube
This project is a JavaScript program that utilizes the Three.js library to create a 3D animation with geometric shapes. It generates a 3D cube and several square planes in a dynamic environment with shader effects.

# Description
The code initializes a scene using Three.js, setting up a 3D environment with a cube and multiple square planes arranged in a specific layout. It utilizes various functions to create and position these geometric shapes, applying shader materials to achieve gradient color effects.

# Features
Generates a 3D cube and square planes using Three.js.
Applies shader materials to create gradient color effects.
Implements animations and transformations on the shapes within the scene.
Utilizes an EffectComposer with RenderPass and UnrealBloomPass for post-processing effects.

# Installation
