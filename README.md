# ThreeJS-Cube
This project is a JavaScript program that utilizes the Three.js library to create a 3D animation with geometric shapes. It generates a 3D cube and several square planes in a dynamic environment with shader effects.

# Description
The code initializes a scene using Three.js, setting up a 3D environment with a cube and multiple square planes arranged in a specific layout. It utilizes various functions to create and position these geometric shapes, applying shader materials to achieve gradient color effects.
